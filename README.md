## Next.js To-Do List App with Firebase Authentication and CRUD Operations

This is a simple To-Do List application built with Next.js, Firebase for authentication, and Firestore for data storage. Users can create, read, update, and delete their private to-do lists after authenticating.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts. Only authenticated users can create and manage their to-do lists.

- CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on their to-do lists.

- Private Lists: Each user has their own private to-do lists. Lists are not visible to other users.

- Real-time Updates: Any changes made to the to-do lists are instantly reflected in the UI thanks to Firebase's real-time database capabilities.
